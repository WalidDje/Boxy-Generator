# Boxy-Generator
React / Redux / Tailwindcss

This is a very interesting project where I used the react/redux toolkit to create different kind of shadows on a visual box.
I use inputs to modify it and redux, store and state to make it work.

# How to see it.
If you want to see this work just copy the repository, press 'npm i' for dependencies and press 'npm run dev'.
Have a good day !
